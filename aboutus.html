    <p>
        That is an excerpt from an email sent from Ms. Orret to 16 girls on September 24, 2020. Those girls made up about only 20% of Ms. Orret's computer science classes. </p> 

        <p>Seven of those girls responded. </p>

        <p style = "font-style: italic; color: gray"> "I really like this idea because this is one of the times where I strongly feel like I am a black sheep and most of my classmates won't take me seriously and things like that. I usually am able to move past feeling like this but its really hitting me hard for some reason this time. I was actually thinking about how there are very few women in the web dev classes during class today." </p>
        <p style = "font-style: italic; color: gray"> "This sounds like a great idea! I'm still very inexperienced in this field, but it's somthing that i've really wanted to get into for a while."</p>
        <p style = "font-style: italic; color: gray">"I think it's a good idea and will help other girls find interests in things like coding and other activities/hobbies that are usually thought to be "male-oriented".</p>
            
        <p>Over Cisco Webex, the idea of a newsletter was born. Just a couple weeks later, we had assigned articles and cover art. We had voted on a layout and name. We had discussed themes, colors, events. We had become the 28% WIS newsletter team.
        On November 1, 2020, we put out our first newsletter. We had 9 subscribers.
    </p>

    <p> It's been three years since that first newsletter came out. Today we have two teams of girls at two high schools, spanning across all four grades. We have layout designers, writers, artists, and social media managers. We send the newsletter to over 150 subscribers. We've published dozens of issues. Thank you to everyone who has supported and subscribed these last three years. There's so much more to come!</p>
