                <p>The first annual 28% Winter Festival was a success! </p>
                <p>We were able to raise funds to cover printing/event costs by selling clay jewelry, holiday cards, and crochet items! </p>
                <p> Drama club had a hot chocolate booth, SAGA brought delicious baked goods, TacoBell was provided by PopPay, Guitar Club played us all some Christmas Carols, and The 28% hosted a raffle for three $50 giftcards!</p>
                <p> It was a lot of fun! Thank you to everyone who stopped by -  see you all next year!!</p>
